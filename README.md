Live coding languages operate by constructing and reconstructing a program designed to create sound. These languages often have domain-specific affordances for sequencing changes over time, commonly described as patterns or sequences. These are rarely completely generic, instead with live coders working within the constraints of their chosen language. This paper presents a novel live coding environment for the existing language "lissajous" that allows sequences of text input to be recorded, replayed, and manipulated just like any other musical parameter.

Co-creation strategies for human-machine collaboration have been explored in various creative disciplines. Recent developments in music technology and artificial intelligence have made these creative interactions applicable to the domain of computer music, meaning it is now possible to interface with algorithms as creative partners. This work looks at bestowing live coding systems with the ability to autonomously create emotionally intelligent musical collaborations and examine new ways of interfacing with musical algorithms.

In this paper we describe the implementation of an autonomous agent for live codingâ€”the practice of creating art in real-time by writing computer code. We aim for this to be a co-creative system, using machine agents to explore not-yet conceptualised code sequences and support coders in asking new questions.

## Stage 2 Document (To be converted into thesis)

Algorithms (of some sort or another) have been present in Western music for many centuries. Current practices, such as live coding, have adopted them in live musical performance settings as a new paradigm of highly-expressive music making. Here, the notions of creativity between humans and computers, and the interaction between the two parties, are considered for live coding systems. Specifically, this work focuses on the effect of affect in computational creativity algorithms, where creativity and music make a uniquely communal human experience. This document serves as an outline of the current state of research and its developments since the Stage 0 was completed in January 2019. The Literature Review provided here is intended to serve as an initial draft for the final thesis document
